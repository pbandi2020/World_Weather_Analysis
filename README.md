### Summary
1. Project 1 - Focused on accessing OpenWeatherAPI and creating a JSON output. Using the JSON a CSV file was created which will be used for vacation search planner site in a later project.
2. Project 2 - Using Gmaps API and using the CSV file from the previous project, we worked on a portal to help the citizens find a vacation destination that meets their temperature preference.
3. Project 3 - Finally we built a map layer that provides a directional layer so they can travel through the cities of their choice.
